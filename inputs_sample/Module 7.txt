Welcome friends to<lp> seventh module of <AB>AI</AB>. We will be discussing<lp> problems with search methods and solutions in<lp> this particular module. We have seen so many search methods. We have seen<HES>uh</HES> unguided search methods, we have seen guided search methods, we have seen<lp> search methods which were<lp> generic which we have, we have, we have used, we have talked about<HES>uh</HES> search methods which we have used in recent times like variable descent and<HES>uh</HES> simulated annealing and all that. 

<HES>umm</HES><lp> Though we the search methods are quite good, there <em>are</em> some problems with these search methods. There's a sometimes a designer has to deal with those problems additionally. We'll be discussing about them<lp> right now. One important problem, one<lp> typical problem that every search method has to deal with is called<lp> the the type of heuristic function. Some heuristic functions only look at the local values and give you decision based on those local values. Sometimes that result into local maxima. <lp>Compared to that some other heuristic <HES>uh</HES><ep> functions are are quite global in the sense that you you give a heuristic value which is globally<lp> correct. In that sense you don't fall into local maxima, you just reach to goal.  We'll look at one typical example here and then we'll move on to other <HES>uh</HES> cases. A lot of other problems for example,<lp> whether the search is assisted<lp> human by human or not, whether the the search method is <HES>uh</HES><ep> is<lp> is to be interrupted to be you require to interact with that search method and so on so forth.  

So this this particular module is about those problems<lp> and and some solutions to them, <PET>okay</PET>. But anyway you they are not <em>general</em> problems. You may encounter them, you may not encounter them based on the problems that you're dealing with. <PET>Okay</PET> Let us begin. <ep><PET>Okay</PET> The first thing. We need to change or modify search methods to <em>adapt</em> to situations. Not every situation is the same, not every problem<HES>uh</HES> looks very similar. You need to adapt. You need to tune, you need<lp> to adjust to it. <lp><PET>Okay</PET> And the first thing is dependency on heuristic function which I've already told you. <ep><PET>Okay</PET> you the other problem is whether you you need to <em>provide</em> explanation. Now search method, that that's one more problem. See if search method is traveling in a direction and gets a solution for example.
